## Work

### Norwegian Army

I have extensive experience in a variety of network and server administration fields from the norwegian army. I have worked with windows servers and cisco network solutions in high tempo, high workload environiments as well as a lot of different proprietary and of the shelf hardware and software. This has given me great fundamentials for learning new systems fast, in cases of both standard and proprietary software and hardware.

## Volunteer

During my time as a student i have been volunteering as a developer for the TIHLDE student organization. This is where i have taught myself TypeScript programming, and gained a lot of general fullstack-knowledge. I addition to the obvious technical experience, this has also provided a lot of experience in teamwork and cooperaton.

### TIHLDE drift
