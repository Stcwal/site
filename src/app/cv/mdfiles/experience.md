## Work

### Norwegian Army

I have extensive experience in a variety of network and server administration fields from the norwegian army. I have worked with windows servers and cisco network solutions in high tempo, high workload environiments as well as a lot of different proprietary and of the shelf hardware and software. This has given me great fundamentials for learning new systems fast, in cases of both standard and proprietary software and hardware.
